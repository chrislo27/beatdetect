# beatdetect

A slimmed-down version of [Minim](https://github.com/ddf/Minim)'s beat detection algorithm.

The license is the same: LGPL-3.0.

Some changes include a removed dependency on Minim, and allowing
non-realtime use.

This was created for the [Rhythm Heaven Remix Editor](https://github.com/chrislo27/RhythmHeavenRemixEditor).
